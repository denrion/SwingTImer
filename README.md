# SwingTImer
School project - Java Swing Timer

Create a Swing GUI application. It should appear on the system tray when started. When the icon is clicked, a popup menu with two option should appear (Settings and Close). Click on settings should open a window where one can define an exact time or time in minutes before the second window shows. Chosen colour shall alternate with white in the second window when the chose time has been reached. Slider control is used to choose the speed at which colours will alternate.
